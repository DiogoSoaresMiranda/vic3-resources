    je_ba_breakaway:0 "Buenos Aires' Independence"
    je_ba_breakaway_reason:0 "Buenos Aires has always been the heart of Argentine economics, trade and politics. It however has also been the focus of anti-caudillismo, and as such has rebelled and declared independence several times through history. Recent turmoil in the region has led the local government to once again consider independence. We need to cull dissent or risk losing the largest port in the country!"
    bs_breakaway_high:0 "We are dealing with daily attacks on federal forces in Buenos Aires. The governor is antsy and may declare independence any day now!"
    bs_breakaway_mid:0 "Trouble is intensifying, we need to do something before the problem gets out of control."
    bs_breakaway_low:0 "Whispers in the streets talk of the incompetence of the federal government."
